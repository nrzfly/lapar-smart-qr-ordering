# Lapar Smart: QR Menu Ordering System

A mobile-first QR code ordering system for **Lazaria Cafe**, developed for FAMA (Federal Agricultural Marketing Authority) staff, built as the implementation for the BIT4008 Undergraduate Project. This app implements the ten use cases described in `002_Chapter_Page_LaparSmart_-_QR_Menu_Ordering_System.docx`.

- **Live demo:** https://lapar-smart.vercel.app
- **Repository:** https://github.com/nrzfly/lapar-smart-qr-ordering
- **Admin dashboard:** https://lapar-smart.vercel.app/admin/login (passcode `admin123`)

## Features (mapped to use cases)

| # | Use Case | Where |
|---|----------|-------|
| UC1 | Scan QR Code | `/` landing page (generates a live QR code linking to the menu) |
| UC2 | View Daily Menu | `/menu` |
| UC3 | Place Order | `/menu` → submit → `/order` |
| UC4 | Reserve Meeting Room Order | `/menu` (tick "Meeting Room reservation") |
| UC5 | Receive Order Notification | `/order/<id>/status` (polls `/api/order/<id>` every 3s) |
| UC6 | Pay at Counter | Admin "Mark Completed" action on `/admin/orders` |
| UC7 | Update Daily Menu | `/admin/menu` |
| UC8 | View Orders | `/admin/orders` |
| UC9 | Update Order Status | `/admin/orders` (Pending → Preparing → Ready → Completed) |
| UC10 | Manage Users | `/admin/users` |

## Tech stack

Matches Chapter 4 of the report: **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** (server-rendered Jinja2 templates, mobile-first CSS, vanilla JS for the cart and notification polling), **Python Flask**, and **SQLite** (built-in).

## Running locally

```bash
python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\activate        # Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
python run.py
```

Then open http://localhost:5000. Demo staff IDs: `S001`, `S002`, `S003`. Admin passcode: `admin123` (override with the `ADMIN_PASSCODE` environment variable).

## Deploying to Vercel

This repo includes `vercel.json` configured for the `@vercel/python` runtime.

```bash
vercel login
vercel --prod
```

### Demo data note — read before presenting

Vercel's serverless functions do not provide a persistent disk. This app stores its SQLite database at `/tmp/laparsmart.db`, seeded automatically on first request, which persists only for the lifetime of **one warm serverless instance**.

In practice this means:
- A single browser tab clicking through one flow start-to-finish (e.g. place an order, then immediately open its own status page) usually stays on the same warm instance and works smoothly.
- But Vercel may route different requests — even seconds apart, e.g. a staff order followed by loading the admin dashboard — to **different** instances, each with its own empty `/tmp`. When that happens an order placed on one instance will not appear on `/admin/orders` served by another, and data resets entirely on a cold start or redeploy.

This was confirmed during testing: an order placed on `/menu` did not appear on `/admin/orders` moments later because the two requests landed on different instances. **For a live presentation, the safest approach is to record a screen-capture walkthrough in one continuous local run (`python run.py`)** rather than relying on the deployed instance to keep state across separate page loads, or accept that the Vercel demo may need a page refresh/retry to land back on the same warm instance.

For a reliable multi-user deployment, replace `app/db.py` with a managed database such as PostgreSQL (e.g. Vercel Postgres, Supabase, or Neon) — the rest of the app (routes, templates) would not need to change since all database access goes through `get_db()`.
